Simple Ludo game written in Java. Project for Java course.

Important notes:

Silver border around a pawn means that there is more than 1 pawn of this color on this tile.

When 2 or more pawns of the same color are standing on a tile, there can't be any knock-outs on this tile.

The beginning tile for each color is safe (no knock-outs)

Game lasts until everyone gets all the pawns to their houses (even the last player).

Otherwise gameplay itself is self-explanatory.
